# CPD_KNN

## Task list

### p1
- [*] Distance Algorithm 
- [ ] Compute points furthest apart
Recursion?
---
### p2
- [*] Orthogonal Projection (in: line(represented by 2 points), one point; out: projected point on the line)
- [*] Project all points in a line and store it 
### p3
- [ ] Create vector with distances from all projections of the points to the left limit of the line
- [ ] Find circle center (median) (possibly the intermediate point)
---
### p?
- [ ] Determine point further apart of the center and thus the radius
- [ ] Split the points in two groups (left and right to the center)
---
### p4
- [ ] Write to the tree, implement the recursion

### Pontos que podemos acelerar

- [ ] Tentar reduzir o n√∫mero de mallocs
